Project Description: Waterfall Flashcards is a flashcard memorization tool that enables users to track their progress on which cards they are doing the worst and best on, and also suggests what cards users should be practicing. There will also be numerical summaries of the cards across all users, along with personalized summaries for each user in the system.

To run this project, we run ‘finalproject.py’. That will re-direct us to the home page and also open a log-in page. We can log-in. Then, we can click `Cards` to edit, add, or view current cards. We can run four different game modes: `Optimize`, `Regular`, `Test`, or `Fall`. We can run the first three by clicking on it on the screen so that it turns bold. To run `Fall`, we click `f` on the keyboard. We can click `Stats` to view our stats for our current user.

This project used tkinter, tkinter.messagebox, random, os, act, and math. 

When we are on a card, we can go to the next card by clicking up and down on the keyboard. That is the preferred way to maneuver around the cards in whatever game mode we are on.
